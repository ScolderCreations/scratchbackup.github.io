## Contributing Guidelines

Howdy! Here's a few suggestions for people wanting to collaborate _(this will make prs more likely to be accepted)_

**1. Try to keep files for projects small**

Smaller files means more space to store new projects. If something is not needed to be able to load a project/it's info, try to leave it out.

**2. If you don't know what something's for, don't mess with it.**

There's a few things I made that don't always make sense- but that doesn't mean they should be removed. Ask before changing something that could harm the website's functionality.

**3. Try to add comments**

Comments explaining pieces of code makes this project easier to contribute to, and means I can be sure i'm not merging in some creepy stuff.
