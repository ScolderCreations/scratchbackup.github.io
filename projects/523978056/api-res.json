  "instructions": "Legends never die...\n\nWhen the world is calling you...\n\nCan you hear them screaming out your name...\n\nThat's right, after almost 3 months, I'm finally back on Scratch! It took multiple appeals to the Scratch Team to get unbanned, but now I'm back.\n\nIt took a lot of time to make, and it's my longest animation yet! (1 minute 30 seconds) It also has 118 frames. I made it a few months ahead of time because I knew that I would get unbanned eventually :)\nIt didn't come out exactly how I wanted it, and some parts are kind of rushed, but that's fine.\n\nThis project was also semi inspired by @Shadow_Kid21 and @-NerdAnimator- closing their comments to help me get unbanned. Thanks guys for helping me out :)\n\nIn a way, the ban was kinda good for me, because I was posting projects a lot before, so I needed a break.\n\nAnyways, since I'm unbanned now, I will be posting new animations again! I will try to post twice a week like I did before.\n\nAlso, if you're wondering where the 5k PFP Contest results out, they'll be out soon! (Like in a few days) I already judged all the entries while I was banned, now I just have to make the results project.\n\nBtw, if you wanna know why I got banned, it was for sharing personal information, and for helping another user get around a block on their account (not from getting mass reported or from going live on YouTube). That's what the ban page said. I'd rather not get into the details, but that's a summary of why I got banned.\n\nAlso, I was never \"permanently banned\" or \"IP banned\". I was just normally banned, and the ban page told me I had to send an appeal to the ST to get unbanned. It just took them a LONG time to answer xD\n\nAlso thanks for 6,000 followers, and for 6 years on Scratch! I was banned when I hit both of those milestones, so I couldn't celebrate them on Scratch :/\n\nCredits:\n\nMusic is Legends Never Die by League of Legends and Against The Current\n\nScratch for the Scratch logo, and for Scratch Cat and Gobo\n\nThanks to @WazzoTV, @huntedskelly, @bluestem, and @Giolaboman for inside of Scratch building inspiration\n\nScratch for making the Scratch Cat and Gobo characters and for the Scratch logo\n\nMade in the Scratch Offline Editor\n\nInspired by @huntedskelly_Test's and @Giolaboman's comeback projects\n\n\nThanks to @Shadow_Kid21, @-NerdAnimator-, @Zinkley, @-AboveTheRainbow-, @Giolaboman, @TheInternetIsCoool, @ChewingFruitGum, @Meekaryo, @-EmberAnimations-, @PopStream, @TNTend, @ShockzEdits, @lisabc, and @FutureTV for OCs (thats a lot of ocs) \n\nAnd thanks to you for watching! \n\n- PaddlerGames",
